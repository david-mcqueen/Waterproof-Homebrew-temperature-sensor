Waterproof-Homebrew-temperature-sensor
======================================
Source code for my Arduino build.
The main components needed: A waterproof thermometer, LCD display, Real Time Clock.
Includes the schematics, readable with http://fritzing.org/home/

Intended extendability:
Connect a 240v mains relaye which will automatically turn on / off a heating belt when the temp falls outside certain bounds.
